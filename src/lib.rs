//! [`defmt`] global logger over USB serial for use with [Embassy].
//!
//! To use this crate spawn the [`run`] task, and use `defmt` as normal. Messages will be sent via
//! USB-CDC to the host, where you should use something such as the [`defmt-print`] CLI tool to
//! print them to your terminal.
//!
//! ## Quickstart
//!
//! Here's an example of using it with [`embassy_rp`], with the general HAL setup elided.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # #![no_std]
//! # #![no_main]
//! # use embassy_rp::{bind_interrupts, Peri};
//! # use embassy_time::Instant;
//! # use embedded_hal_async::delay::DelayNs;
//! # use panic_halt as _;
//! # bind_interrupts!(struct Irqs {
//! #     USBCTRL_IRQ => embassy_rp::usb::InterruptHandler<embassy_rp::peripherals::USB>;
//! # });
//! #[embassy_executor::task]
//! async fn defmtusb_wrapper(usb: Peri<'static, embassy_rp::peripherals::USB>) {
//!     let driver = embassy_rp::usb::Driver::new(usb, Irqs);
//!     let usb_config = {
//!         let mut c = embassy_usb::Config::new(0x1234, 0x5678);
//!         c.serial_number = Some("defmt");
//!         c.max_packet_size_0 = 64;
//!         c.composite_with_iads = true;
//!         c.device_class = 0xEF;
//!         c.device_sub_class = 0x02;
//!         c.device_protocol = 0x01;
//!         c
//!     };
//!     defmt_embassy_usbserial::run(driver, usb_config).await;
//! }
//! #
//! # #[embassy_executor::main]
//! # async fn main(spawner: embassy_executor::Spawner) {
//! #     let peripherals = embassy_rp::init(Default::default());
//! #     let mut delay = embassy_time::Delay;
//!
//! // Inside your main function.
//! spawner.must_spawn(defmtusb_wrapper(peripherals.USB));
//! loop {
//!     defmt::info!("Hello! {=u64:ts}", Instant::now().as_secs());
//!     delay.delay_ms(1000).await;
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Wrapper task
//!
//! A wrapper task is required because this library can't provide a task for you to spawn, since it
//! has to be generic over the USB driver struct. While the quickstart example provides a
//! straightforward example of constructing both the driver and the configuration in this task,
//! ultimately the only requirement is that it awaits [`defmt_embassy_usbserial::run`].
//!
//! Of course, `run` is just an async function whose returned future can be `join`ed, etc.
//!
//! ## Configuration
//!
//! For USB-CDC to be set up properly, you _must_ set the correct values in the configuration
//! struct. If `composite_with_iads` is `true` (the default), you _must_ use the following values
//! as `embassy-usb` will [fail an assertion][eusb-assert] if you do not:
//!
//! | Field | Value |
//! |-------|-------|
//! |`device_class`|`0xEF`|
//! |`device_sub_class`|`0x02`|
//! |`device_protocol`|`0x01`|
//!
//! If `composite_with_iads` is `false`, you do not have to use these exact values: the standard
//! CDC device class code (`device_class`) is `0x02`. You should choose the values appropriate to
//! your application. If your only concern is transporting defmt logs over USB serial, default to
//! the values in the table above.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! Please see the `device-examples/` directory in the repository for device-specific "hello world"
//! examples. These examples have all been tested on real hardware and are known to work.
//!
//! ## Known limitations
//!
//! ### Old or corrupt defmt messages are received after reconnecting
//!
//! If you stop reading the logs from the USB serial port, for example by closing `defmt-print`,
//! when you reconnect you will likely receive part of one old defmt message (and potentially
//! several complete out-out-date messages), and the first up-to-date defmt message will be
//! corrupt.
//!
//! This is ultimately because the internal buffers are not aware of defmt frame boundaries. The
//! first case will occur because the writing task will block part-way through writing an internal
//! buffer to the USB serial port, and continues writing that now-stale buffer when you start
//! reading again. (This may be avoided in a future release by way of a timeout.)
//!
//! The second is because that buffer may end part-way through a defmt message, and the next buffer
//! that is written will likely start part-way through a defmt message. `defmt-print` may
//! explicitly report these frames as malformed, or may silently misinterpret values to be included
//! in a format message.
//!
//! Note as well that ceasing to read from the serial port does not disable defmt logging; it seems
//! that only disconnecting from USB will trigger the event that toggles the logger.
//!
//! ### High message latency
//!
//! It may take some time for you to start receiving messages, and they may come through in bursts.
//! This is due to the implementation waiting until one of its internal buffers is full before
//! writing to the USB serial port. This effect will be more pronounced if you choose a larger
//! buffer size feature, and if you have messages with few (or no) formatting
//! parameters, as this greatly reduces the size of the data that needs to be transferred.
//!
//! It may be possible to make the implementation aware of defmt messages, so that they come
//! through in a more stream-like manner. Suggestions and contributions on this would be greatly
//! appreciated.
//!
//! ### Buffers flushed only every 100ms
//!
//! Conversely, if you have a high volume of messages, there is at present a 100ms delay after
//! writing an internal buffer to USB. It is planned to make this configurable.
//!
