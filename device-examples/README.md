These are simple "hello world" examples that show the basic setup needed to use defmtusb
with various Embassy and Embassy-compatible HALs.

The list below shows which HALs correspond to which chips for which there are
examples. This is _not_ a compatibility list, beyond the fact that these
examples are known to work on those chips.

- `embassy-rp`: both RP2040 and RP235x
- `esp-hal`: ESP32-S2
